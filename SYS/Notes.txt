TODO:
    -Assembler/linker/disassembler
    -BIOS
        :basic functions for setting, clearing, copying, moving mem
        :checking if mem is reserved (as defined in the config)
        :store fx's in excess memory
    -Memory mapping for ROM/RAM/IO

    -IDEA:
        Multiple refreshing screens/menus, for mem monitoring and debugging

        Save CPU state+memory when shutting down, load when starting up
            seamless and continuous computer use
            Save user data, info, name, etc in memory

    *** IO ***
        Some 8 bit registers for serial ports?
        Allow interfacing with physical components?
        Also allows input and output control via software
        Can use to "plug in" code you want to load into the machine


    *** GRAPHICS ***
        ~12,672 bytes for VRAM
        $0280 - $3400 = 0x3180 wide

    *** SYS FOLDER ***
        BIOS binary
        CONFIG JSON file
        Entire system image binary


    *** In ASSEMBLER.C ***
        -INCEPT_MEMORY:
            :Flashes CPU memory from bin file
            :Either entire image or just part
                -optimize file writing using fread for only one operation?
            :****WRITE FILE FOR DEFAULT SYSTEM IMAGE, WILL ALSO LOAD ON STARTUP****

        -CSV_PSEUDO_TO_BIN:
            :Converts newline-delimited pseudo-assembly into binary file of machine code

        -TXT_TO_BIN:
            :Converts text file hex machine code into binary file that
            :can then be flashed using INCEPT_MEMORY

        -MEM_TO_BIN:
            :Exports memory contents as binary file
